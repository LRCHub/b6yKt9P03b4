That little second that I turned away
I got up and left 'cause I had nothing to say
That little moment I brushed you aside
I walked out the door
And you just stood there and cried

And I take it back
I take it back
What I said to you
And what I put you through
And I take it back
I take it back
To where it all began
Oh baby, if I had the chance

And as those years start slipping away
I'm kissed by your memory more and more everyday
If I was granted just one wish tonight
It would be to return
To where we last said goodbye

And I take it back
I take it back
What I said to you
And what I put you through
And I take it back
I take it back
To where it all began
Oh baby, if I had the chance
Baby, if I had the chance
(Baby, if I had the chance)

Whatever happens
I just have to believe
If you can find it
Find it in your heart
There's another chance for me

And I take it back
I take it back
What I said to you
And what I put you through
And I take it back
I take it back
To where it all began
Oh baby, if I had
Oh baby, baby, baby
Baby, if I had the chance

I just want, I just want
I just want, just want, just want

Baby, if I had the chance
