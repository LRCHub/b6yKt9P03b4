[00:07.95] Take it back, take it back,
[00:12.45] Take that thing right out of here.
[00:15.75] Right away, far away,
[00:20.15] Take that thing right out of here.
[00:26.68] Don't let them take me
[00:27.92] To where streams are red.
[00:30.42] I want to stay here
[00:32.03] And sleep in my own bed.
[00:34.38] Need all your loving,
[00:36.03] Long blonde hair.
[00:38.00] Don't let them take me,
[00:39.92] 'Cause I'm easily scared.
[00:41.53] Take it back, take it back,
[00:46.18] Take that thing right out of here.
[00:51.47] Take it back, take it back,
[00:56.05] Take that thing right out of here.
[00:59.39] Right away, far away,
[01:03.63] Take that thing right out of here.
[01:10.07] I got this great need,
[01:12.06] The need to stay alive.
[01:13.25] Not ashamed of my creed,
[01:15.63] I've got to survive.
[01:18.05] So come on, baby,
[01:20.04] Don't go away.
[01:22.00] Just let them save me
[01:23.46] For a rainy day.
[01:24.97] Take it back, take it back,
[01:29.81] Take that thing right out of here.
[01:53.78] I got this need,
[01:55.45] The need to stay alive.
[01:57.71] Not ashamed of my creed,
[01:59.33] I've got to survive.
[02:01.81] So come on, baby,
[02:03.57] Don't go away.
[02:05.49] Just let them save me
[02:06.99] For a rainy day.
[02:08.79] Take it back, take it back,
[02:13.52] Take that thing right out of here.
[02:18.74] Take it back, take it back,
[02:23.48] Take that thing right out of here.
[02:26.65] Right away, far away,
[02:31.14] Take that thing right out of here.
[02:37.30] I got this thing;
[02:39.39] I've got to keep it sharp.
[02:41.23] Don't go to places
[02:42.68] Where it won't shine in the dark.
[02:45.35] So come on, baby,
[02:47.02] Don't go away.
[02:49.01] Just let them save me
[02:50.62] For a rainy day.
[02:52.19] Take it back, take it back,
[02:57.17] Take that thing right out of here.
